  <p>
    It is possible that anyone who visits Hereford Cathedral, after
    having visited the other two great Cathedral Churches of the
    West of England, Worcester and Gloucester, may feel a little
    disappointed, for it is smaller and plainer than either of them,
    and there are not so many stories that can be told about it. It
    has no Royal Tomb, nor any great outstanding Saint, yet in one
    respect it is the most interesting of the three.</p>
  <p>
    Indeed, in this one respect, it is the most interesting of all the
    English Cathedrals, for it does not only carry our thoughts back,
    as the others do, to the days when the torch of Christianity was
    re-lit in England by missionaries from Iona and Canterbury, but it
    takes them farther back still to the days when the early British
    Church existed, and had Bishops of her own; for, as doubtless you
    know, Christianity was brought to Britain from Gaul as early as
    two hundred years after Christ.</p>
  <p>
    We do not know who brought it. The names of the first missionaries
    are forgotten. Probably they were humble Christian soldiers who
    came in the ranks of the Roman legions, and they would be followed
    by a few priests sent after them by the Church in Gaul to minister
    to them; and from the ranks of these priests one or two Bishops
    would be consecrated.</p>
  <p>
    It all happened so long ago that it seems vague and far away, and
    it is difficult to pick out authentic facts.</p>
  <p>
    We can only say with an old historian, that ‘we see that the Light
    of the Word shined here, but see not who kindled it.’</p>
  <p>
    Perhaps you know also that this early Christianity was swept away
    from all parts of the country, except in Ireland and Wales, by the
    coming of the heathen Angles, Saxons, and Danes.</p>
  <p>
    We can easily understand how these two parts of what to us is one
    Kingdom, managed to hold the Faith. They were more or less
    undisturbed by the fierce invaders who came from the North of
    Germany and from Denmark, and who were quite content to settle
    down in fertile England without taking the trouble to cross the
    Irish Channel and fight with the savage Irish tribes, or penetrate
    into the wild and hilly regions of Wales.</p>
  <p>
    So it came about that, while the English people were so harassed
    and worried with war and cruelty that they forgot all about the
    new doctrines which had been beginning to gain a slender foothold
    in their land, the people of Wales had still their Church and
    Bishops.</p>
  <p>
    These Bishops seem to have held much the same Sees as the Welsh
    Bishops hold to-day. Bangor, Llandaff, Menevia or St. Davids,
    Llanelwy or St. Asaph, and three others with strange Welsh names,
    one of which was Cærffawydd, which meant the ‘place of beeches,’
    and which we now know as Hereford.</p>
  <p>
    For in these days Wales was larger than it is now, and was bounded
    by the Severn, and Cærffawydd was a Welsh town, if town it could
    be called, not an English one.</p>
  <p>
    These Bishops were governed by an Archbishop, who is spoken of
    sometimes as living at Carleon-on-Usk, sometimes at Llandaff, and
    sometimes at Hereford.</p>
  <p>
    Now, of course you have all heard about King Arthur and his
    Knights of the Round Table; and you may have read about them in
    Tennyson’s ‘Idylls of the King’; about their bravery, and chivalry,
     and purity, and how they took an oath—</p>
  <div class="poem">
    <p class="pQ v2">
      ‘To break the heathen and uphold the Christ;</p>
    <p>
      To ride abroad, redressing human wrongs;</p>
    <p>
      To speak no slander—no, nor listen to it;’</p>
  </div>
  <p class="i0 v2">
    and about Bishop Dubric, who crowned the King at Cirencester, and
    married him to Guinevere his wife.</p>
  <p>
    Part of those wonderful stories is purely legendary, but part is
    true, for it is believed that King Arthur was a real person, and
    so were many of his Knights.</p>
  <p>
    Bishop Dubric, or Dubricus, certainly was a real person, for we
    know that he was Bishop of Cærffawydd, and it is said that it was
    Sir Geraint, the Knight who married Enid, and rode with her, in
    her old faded dress, to Court, who built the first little church
    here, where the Bishop had his chair or ‘stool.’</p>
  <p>
    Be this as it may, it is certain that there was a tiny little
    Cathedral here, long before the other English Cathedrals were
    thought of, for you know that a church is a Cathedral, no matter
    how small it is, if it has a Bishop’s official chair inside it.
    And it is probable that this little Cathedral was built of wood,
    and roofed with reeds or wattles.</p>

      THE QUEEN HANDS THE DRUGGED CUP TO ETHELBERT. <i>Page 20.</i></p>
  </div>
  <p class="v6">
    It must have been rebuilt, or at least repaired, once or twice
    during the centuries that followed, but we know very little about
    its history until we come to the year <small>A.D.</small> 794,
    when a terrible event happened which led to a larger and more
    stately church being erected, this time of stone.</p>
  <p id="foot_1">
    If you have read the story of St. Albans Cathedral,<a
      href="#fn_1"
      class="anchor">1</a>
    you will know what this event was; but I will try to tell you more
    fully about it here, for although it is very sad, it gives us a
    true picture of what even the life of Kings was, in these dark and
    troublous ages.</p>
  <p>
    The name of the King who reigned over East Anglia—that is, the
    land of the ‘North folk’ and the ‘South folk,’ or, as we call it,
    Norfolk and Suffolk—in these days was Ethelbert, and he had an
    only son, Ethelbert the Ætheling.</p>
  <p>
    This Ethelbert was such a goodly youth, so tall and straight and
    handsome, so skilled in all manner of knightly exercises, and so
    kind to the poor and needy, that all his father’s subjects adored
    him.</p>
  <p>
    He loved God with all his heart, and would fain have given up his
    princely state and retired into some religious house, so that he
    might have more time to study His Word, and to learn about Him.</p>
  <p>
    But he had plenty of what we call ‘common sense,’ so when his
    father died, and he was left King in his stead, he said to
    himself, ‘Now must I bestir myself and put away the dreams of my
    youth.<a id="foot_2"> </a> I had visions of forsaking the world
    like Cuthbert or Bede, or the holy Paulinus, who won King Edwin
    to the Faith.<a
      href="#fn_2"
      class="anchor">2</a>
    But if it had been the will of God that I should serve Him in this
    manner, I would not have been born an Ætheling,<a
      href="#fn_3"
      class="anchor">3</a>
    and inheritor of the throne of East Anglia; and, seeing He hath
    thus dealt with me, I must serve Him according to His will, and
    not according to mine own. Therefore will I seek to be a just and
    true King.’</p>
  <p>
    Then, knowing that a King has need of a wife, he sent for all the
    aldermen and wise men of his Kingdom, as soon as the days of
    mourning for his father were over, and told them that he wished to
    wed the Princess Elfreda, daughter of Offa, King of Mercia, and
    that he willed that a deputation should go from among them to the
    Court of that Monarch, to ask, in his name, for her hand.</p>
  <p>
    Now, this Offa was a very great and mighty King, who cared for
    nothing so much as to extend the boundaries of his Kingdom, and
    he had succeeded in doing this in an extraordinary way. He had
    conquered the parts of the country which are now known as Kent,
    Sussex, Essex, and Surrey, and on the West he had driven back the
    Welsh beyond Shrewsbury, and had built a huge earthwork, which was
    known as ‘Offa’s Dyke,’ to mark the boundary of their domains. In
    this way it came about that in his days Cærffawydd, or ‘Fernlege,’
    as it had come to be called, was in Mercia instead of Wales.</p>
  <p>
    He had built for himself a great Castle at Sutton, near the
    banks of the Wye, and here he was holding his Court when King
    Ethelbert’s Ambassadors arrived, and laid their request before
    him.</p>
  <p>
    He granted it at once, for he had but two daughters, the elder of
    whom, Eadburh, was married to Beorhtric, King of the West Saxons,
    who owed allegiance to him, and he thought that he would also have
    a certain power over the young Monarch of the East Angles if
    Elfreda became his wife.</p>
  <p>
    So the grave bearded aldermen returned to their own land, and told
    their Royal Master how they had fared.</p>
  <p>
    King Ethelbert was overjoyed at the success of his suit, and
    appointed a day on which he would set out, accompanied by all his
    retinue, to travel to the pleasant West Country in order to fetch
    home his bride.</p>
  <p>
    Now, in those days people believed a great deal in dreams, and
    omens, and signs, and the old chroniclers tell us that, just
    before the young man set out, his mother, Queen Laonorine, came to
    him, and begged him not to go, because it was a very dark and
    cloudy morning, and she had had a bad dream the night before.</p>
  <p>
    ‘Look at the clouds,’ she said; ‘they be so black, methinks they
    portend evil.’</p>
  <p>
    ‘Nay, but clouds break,’ answered her son cheerily.</p>
  <p>
    ‘Yea! Verily! But ‘tis from clouds a thunderbolt may come,’
    replied the anxious mother.</p>
  <p>
    ‘Let us not trust in omens, but in the living God, who “ordereth a
    good man’s goings,”’ replied the King, and, kissing her, he joined
    his nobles, who were already on horseback waiting for him outside,
    and rode gaily away.</p>
  <p>
    It was the month of May, and for four days they rode through the
    fresh green lanes, till they drew near to where the powerful
    Monarch dwelt.</p>
  <p>
    They crossed the Severn at Worcester, and rode over the great hill
    of Malvern, and when they were within a day’s journey of the Royal
    Palace of Sutton, they pitched their tents at Fernlege, on the
    banks of the Wye, and there Ethelbert and most of his nobles
    waited, while one or two knights rode forward to inform King Offa
    of his arrival.</p>
  <p>
    In the evening, so the quaint old story goes, the young King left
    his tent, and, ascending a little hillock, from whence he could
    obtain a wide view of the surrounding country, sat down at the
    root of a giant oak-tree.</p>
  <p>
    Everything was so fair and peaceful that he smiled as he
    remembered his mother’s fears, and he thought to himself how
    delighted she would be when he arrived at home once more,
    accompanied by his beautiful young bride. Musing thus he fell
    asleep, and dreamed a dream.</p>
  <p>
    He dreamt that he was standing beside the little church which
    stood down by the riverside, which had been founded by Sir
    Geraint, and that all of a sudden an angel appeared, who carried
    a basin in his hand, and, to the King’s horror, the basin was full
    of blood.</p>
  <p>
    But the angel’s calm face was quite untroubled as he picked a
    little bunch of herbs and dipped them in the blood, and began to
    sprinkle the rude little building with the scarlet drops.</p>
  <p>
    And lo! to Ethelbert’s amazement, the building began slowly to
    change; it grew bigger and higher, and the reeds and wattles
    turned to blocks of stone, and presently a magnificent Minster
    stood in its place.</p>
  <p>
    Apparently it was some great Festival, for a sweet-toned organ was
    pealing inside, while from all directions multitudes of people
    came thronging to the church, singing hymns of praise as they did
    so. And as they drew near the King, he heard that there was one
    name which mingled with the name of God and of the Saints upon
    their lips, and that name was his own, ‘Ethelbert.’</p>
  <p>
    Wondering greatly, he awoke, and the vision passed quickly from
    his mind, for at that moment his Ambassadors returned, bearing
    courteous greetings from the Mercian Monarch, who hoped that on
    the morrow he would come with all speed to his Palace.</p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, at Sutton, a scene was going on which is almost the
    story of Ahab and Jezebel and Naboth’s vineyard over again.</p>
  <p>
    For King Offa and his wife, Queen Quendreda, were sitting in the
    King’s private chamber, talking about their coming guest and his
    fertile dominions, just as Ahab and Jezebel had talked about
    Naboth.</p>
  <p>
    And Quendreda was putting an awful thought into Offa’s mind. ‘It
    were a good thing,’ so she whispered, ‘to have the King of East
    Anglia for a son-in-law, but it were a better to murder him
    quietly, and add his Kingdom to that of Mercia. Then would Offa be
    a mighty Monarch indeed.’</p>
  <p>
    I think there is no sadder picture in the whole of English history
    than this, which shows us this great and wise King, for remember
    he <i>was</i> a great and wise King, who had done an immense
    amount of good to his country, whose name might have been handed
    down to us, like that of Alfred the Great, or Victoria the Good,
    or Edward the Peacemaker, sitting listening to the advice of his
    wife, who was a thoroughly wicked woman, seeing clearly how bad,
    and cruel, and treacherous that advice was—aye, and saying so,
    too—and yet feeling tempted in his heart of hearts to follow it,
    because of the one weak spot in his otherwise strong character,
    his ungovernable lust for land and power.</p>
  <p>
    If only he could have looked into the future, and seen how that
    one dark deed would leave a stain on his memory, which would last
    when his good deeds would be forgotten, and how a blight would
    descend on his house almost as though it were a direct judgment
    from God, I think he would have ordered his wife to be silent,
    and never to speak such words to him again.</p>
  <p>
    But to see into the future is impossible. So, as if to shake the
    responsibility from his own shoulders, he did not actually forbid
    the scheme, but he pretended to be very angry, and strode out into
    the hall, and called to his knights and to his son, Prince
    Ecgfrith, to mount and ride with him to meet the stranger King.</p>
  <p>
    When he was gone, the unscrupulous Queen, who felt that she was
    now at liberty to work her wicked will, sent for the King’s most
    trusty henchman, Cymbert, the Warden of the Castle, who was tall,
    and strong, and a mighty fighter, but who had a heart as hard as
    stone.</p>

  </div>
  <p class="v6">
    When he had answered the summons, and come and bowed low before
    her, the Queen said to him: ‘Cymbert, it is not fitting that thou,
    the Warden of this mighty Castle, shouldst be but a slave and a
    thrall, wouldst thou not like to be a freeman?’</p>
  <p>
    ‘That would I, O Queen,’ replied the henchman.</p>
  <p>
    ‘And more than that, wouldst thou earn land of thine own, where
    thou couldst build a house?’</p>
  <p>
    ‘Yea, verily!’ was the answer.</p>
  <p>
    ‘All these things shall be thine,’ said Quendreda, ‘if thou wilt
    but carry out my orders. Thou knowest that this very day the King
    of the East Angles cometh, that he may wed my daughter. ’Tis my
    wish to have him put to death, so that his Kingdom may be joined
    to that of Mercia.</p>
  <p>
    ‘To this end I will lodge him in the Royal chamber, beneath which,
    as thou knowest, runs a secret passage, which leads to the little
    postern in the wall.</p>
  <p>
    ‘Thou must arrange a trap-door in the flooring, which will sink or
    rise at will, and over it I will cause a couch to be placed.</p>
  <p>
    ‘Then, to-night, at supper, I will make the Monarch pledge me in a
    cup of wine, into which I will empty a potion. When he feeleth
    sleep come creeping upon him, he will retire to his chamber, and
    throw himself on the couch, and, to a man like thee, all the rest
    will be easy.</p>
  <p>
    ‘When he is dead, thou canst take his body out of the postern by
    stealth, and bury it, and no man will know what hath become of
    him.’</p>
  <p>
    At the very moment that this wicked scheme was being arranged, the
    two Kings and their trains had met, and after greeting one another
    courteously they all came riding, with great joy, home to the
    Castle.</p>
  <p>
    The black-hearted Queen went out to meet them, but her fair young
    daughter, Princess Elfrida, was not with her. She was too shy and
    modest to greet her lover in public, so she had crept up alone to
    the top of the Castle, and stood there, peering over the
    battlements, to see what manner of man he had become. For it was
    not the first time that they had met. They had been playmates in
    their youth when Ethelbert as Ætheling had visited Sutton with his
    father, and they had thought much of each other ever since.</p>
  <p>
    And it chanced that Ethelbert glanced up at the battlements, and
    when he saw the maiden, with her flaxen locks and blue eyes,
    looking down at him, his heart leaped for joy, and as soon as he
    had greeted the Queen, and quaffed a cup of mead, he made his way
    up to where she was, and there they sat together, so the old books
    tell us, all the sunny afternoon, while the rest of the gallant
    company, King Offa, and Prince Ecgfrith, and all the knights and
    nobles, went a-hunting the wild wolves in the forest near by.</p>
 <p id="foot_4">
    And as they sat they talked together, and Ethelbert told the
    Princess how all the people of East Anglia were looking forward
    to welcome their young Queen; and, both of them being true
    Christians, they made a solemn vow that they would rule their
    land in ‘righteousness and the fear of God, even as King Ethelbert
    of Kent and Bertha his wife had ruled their kingdom.’<a
      href="#fn_4"
      class="anchor">4</a></p>
  <p>
    That night a great feast was held in the Palace of Sutton, a
    feast more magnificent and gorgeous than had ever been held there
    before. King Offa sat at the head of the table, wearing his royal
    robes and the golden crown of Mercia on his head. Beside him sat
    his wife, and close by were the youthful bride and bridegroom, and
    ‘that noble youth Ecgfrith’ as the old chroniclers call him.</p>
  <p>
    Nobles and thanes and aldermen crowded round the board, and
    gleemen who sang fierce war-songs of Hengist and of Cerdic, and of
    Arthur and his Knights, and the red wine was poured out, and they
    drank long and heartily; more heartily, perhaps, than they ought
    to have done.</p>
  <p>
    For the Queen made Cymbert, who stood behind the King’s chair,
    fill his cup again and again with strong, fierce wine, which had
    been a present from the Frankish King, and when his brain was
    heated, and he was not master of himself, she leant against him,
    and whispered in his ear; and the poor half-drunken Monarch
    muttered that she could do as she would, little recking that from
    that time the glory would depart from his house.</p>
  <p>
    Then she spoke lightly and gaily to her guest, handing him a
    golden cup filled with wine as she did so.</p>
  <p>
    ‘Now must thou drink to us, fair sir, and to thy bride, even as we
    have drunk success and long life to thee.’</p>
  <p>
    And the young King took it gladly, and drank the blood-red draught,
     little dreaming that it had been drugged by the cruel hand that
     gave it to him.</p>
  <p>
    But so it was, and soon, feeling drowsy, he retired to his
    chamber, and dismissing his attendants, threw himself, all
    undressed, on the couch, and fell into a heavy slumber.</p>
  <p>
    You know the rest of the sad story: how the trap-door fell, and
    the couch fell with it, and how Cymbert the Warden either
    smothered him with the silken cushions among which he was lying,
    or, what is more likely, cut off his head with his own sword, for
    the tale is told either way.</p>
  <p>
    When the cruel deed was done, the Warden and the servants who were
    with him, took the lifeless body, and carried it out secretly by
    the postern, and at first thought of throwing it into the
    river.</p>
  <p>
    But remembering that the Queen had ordered it to be buried,
    Cymbert made the others dig a great hole, into which they flung
    it, and, such was the wildness and lawlessness of the time, when
    they had covered it up, and stamped down the earth upon it, they
    thought that the whole matter was ended.</p>
  <p>
    That was a very great mistake, however, for, although the deed was
    done, there were many, many consequences to follow. It was as when
    a stone is thrown into the midst of a pond. The stone may sink,
    but in sinking it makes ripples which go on widening and widening
    until they cover the whole surface of the water.</p>
  <p>
    Of course the murder could not be hidden, for on the very next
    morning the East Anglian thanes and noblemen demanded to know what
    had become of their Master, and when they discovered the fate that
    had befallen him, they made haste to flee, in case they too should
    be murdered.</p>
  <p>
    Then the next thing that happened was that Princess Elfrida, the
    poor broken-hearted young bride, felt so shocked and terrified at
    the thought that her own father had allowed the man she was about
    to marry to be put to death in such a treacherous manner, that she
    was afraid to live at home any longer, so she slipped out of the
    Palace, accompanied by one or two trusty attendants, and fled to a
    monastery at Crowland in the Fen country, where she became a
    nun.</p>
  <p>
    Perhaps that was the first thing that made King Offa’s conscience
    begin to prick, but, like King Ahab, he tried to brazen the matter
    out; saying to himself, “The deed is done and I cannot undo it,
    so I may as well have the Kingdom.” So he sent an army to East
    Anglia, and took possession of it.</p>
  <p>
    But I think that all the time he must have been feeling more and
    more unhappy, for, remember, at heart he was a good man, and had
    lived, up to this time, a noble and honourable life; and a certain
    terror must have fallen upon him when, two months later, his wife
    Quendreda died, and, sitting by his desolate hearth, he remembered
    the old story of the King of Israel who had done as he had done,
    and on whom the wrath of God had so speedily fallen.</p>
  <p>
    It must have been almost a relief when one day Eadwulf, Bishop of
    Lichfield, came to him and said: ‘What is this that thou hast
    done? Killed a defenceless man in thine own Palace, and taken
    possession of his Kingdom. Hadst thou killed him in open battle,
    no one could have blamed thee, but to murder him in secret when he
    came as a friend was not worthy of thee, O King.’</p>
  <p>
    ‘I know it, I know it,’ replied Offa, who was now thoroughly sorry
    for his deed; ‘but it was the wine which I drank, which my wife
    gave to me. It inflamed my brain so that I knew not what I
    said.’</p>
  <p>
    Now, at that time people had the idea that they could atone for
    any wicked act that they had done by giving money or lands to the
    Church, or going on some pilgrimage; so Eadwulf told King Offa
    that he thought that first of all he had better see that King
    Ethelbert’s body had Christian burial—you remember it had just
    been thrown into a hole—and that after that he must go a
    pilgrimage to Rome, and tell the Pope the whole story, and do
    whatever he told him to do as a punishment.</p>
  <p>
    Then he added some words which were very solemn, but which turned
    out only too true. This was what he said: ‘Because thou hast
    repented of thy evil deed thy sin will be forgiven; nevertheless,
    the sword shall not depart from thine house. It was in thine heart
    that Mercia should be the greatest of English Kingdoms, and so it
    might have been. But now the glory shall depart from thee, and
    another King, even the King of Wessex, shall be greater in power
    and shall become the first King of the whole of England.’</p>
  <p>
    Offa did as he was bid. He had the body of the young King taken
    from its rude grave, and buried in the little church of reeds and
    wattles at Fernlege, near which Ethelbert had sat and mused on the
    night before his death.</p>
  <div class="ctr pgbreak v6" id="i_31">

    <p class="v1 sm">

  </div>
  <p class="v6">
    Then he went to Rome and told the whole story to the Pope, and
    said how penitent he was, and how gladly he would do anything in
    his power to atone for his sin; and the Pope, who wanted to have
    more churches built in England, told him to go home again, and
    show his sorrow by building a really fine church at St.
    Albans—where the first English martyr Alban laid down his life for
    the Faith—and another at Fernlege, where there was only the plain
    little Cathedral Church of wood.</p>
  <p>
    Offa promised that he would do these things, and when he returned
    to England he gave orders that the two buildings should be begun
    without delay. Very soon afterwards he died, and it fell to the
    lot of one of his Viceroys, whose name was Milfred, to carry out
    his plans at Fernlege, and to build an ‘admirable stone church’
    there.</p>
  <p>
    And so King Offa vanishes from history, and although we cannot
    doubt that his penitence was very deep, and that his great sin was
    forgiven, it is very striking to read how Bishop Eadwulf’s words
    were fulfilled, and how the glory did indeed ‘depart from his
    house.’</p>
  <p>
    We have seen how his wife died, and how his youngest and fairest
    daughter became a nun. Then he himself died and was buried, not in
    either of the two great Minsters which he had caused to be
    erected, but in a little chapel on the banks of the Ouse, near
    Bedford. One day a dreadful flood came, and the Ouse overflowed
    its banks and washed away the chapel, and King Offa’s bones along
    with it, and no one ever knew what became of them.</p>
  <p>
    Soon afterwards his only son, Prince Ecgfrith, died, and slowly
    the Kingdom of Mercia grew less and less important, and the little
    Kingdom of Wessex grew greater and greater, until its King, King
    Ecgbert, great-grandfather of Alfred the Great, became ‘Overlord’
    of the whole of England.</p>
  <p>
    As for King Offa’s eldest daughter, Eadburh, her story is the
    saddest of all, for she was a wicked woman like her mother; and
    she did one bad thing after another, until at last she had neither
    money nor friends left; and the old chroniclers tell us that, ‘in
    the days of Alfred, who reigned over the West Saxons, and who was
    Overlord of all the Kingdoms of England, there were many men yet
    living who had seen Eadburh, daughter of Offa, and wife of
    Beorhtric, begging her bread.’</p>
  <p>
    But it is pleasant to think that if Eadwulf’s words came true in
    such a terrible way, the dream or vision which poor King Ethelbert
    had on the last night of his life came true also, but in a much
    happier and sweeter manner.</p>
  <p>
    For, as I have said, under the direction of Milfred, King Offa’s
    Viceroy, a noble stone church replaced the little wooden one at
    Fernlege, or, as it soon began to be called, ‘Hereford,’ which
    means ‘The Ford of the Army,’ because, when the Mercian soldiers
    wished to pass into Wales, they crossed the River Wye at this
    point.</p>
  <p>
    This new church was dedicated to ‘St. Ethelbert and the Blessed
    Virgin,’ and into it, when it was finished, the Bishop’s chair was
    carried.</p>
  <p>
    For, although the young King could not be called a martyr, he
    certainly left the record of a pure and brave and noble life
    behind him, and it seemed fitting—and we are glad that it did
    so—that the memory of his name should linger, all down the ages,
    round the stately Cathedral which was built as an expiation of his
    death, and in which, for half a century at least, his body
    rested.</p>
  <p>
    It was not taken into the new Cathedral at once, however, which
    seems rather curious, but it was left for more than a hundred
    years in the grave in which it had been laid by Offa, before he
    went on his pilgrimage to Rome.</p>
  <p>
    Perhaps this was because there was constant fighting going on all
    these years between the people of Mercia and the Welsh; and
    Hereford, being just on the border of the two Kingdoms, was so
    constantly exposed to the danger of being raided, or looted, or
    burned down, that no one had any time to think about anything
    else.</p>
  <p>
    But at last there came a period of peace, and the Bishop of
    Hereford who was living then, whose name was Æthelstan, determined
    that he would restore the Cathedral, which had got sadly knocked
    about in these border quarrels. When he had done so, he took King
    Ethelbert’s bones from their humble resting-place, and had them
    brought into his newly restored church and placed in a gorgeous
    shrine which he had prepared for their reception.</p>
  <p>
    A great misfortune fell upon this good Bishop, for, for the last
    thirteen years of his life, he was blind, and I have no doubt
    that, during all the long period when he could not see, it must
    have been a great joy to him to think, as he was led out and in
    to Service, that he had been allowed, before the darkness fell on
    him, to repair the House of God, and to provide a fitting tomb for
    the royal youth in whose memory it had been erected.</p>
  <p>
    Alas! he little knew what a few short years were to bring; and we
    almost wish that the poor old man had died before his life-work
    was all undone.</p>
  <p>
    For in 1056 a quarrel took place between Elfgar, Earl of Chester,
    and Edward the Confessor, who was King of England at that time. I
    do not know what the quarrel was about, but at any rate Elfgar was
    summoned to appear before the ‘Witan,’ or Parliament in London, on
    a charge of high treason.</p>
  <p>
    His guilt was not proved, but the King was so angry with him that
    he made him an outlaw, which was, of course, very unjust.</p>
  <p>
    Elfgar, as was to be expected in these old warlike days,
    determined to have his revenge, so he went and hired the services
    of a band of Danish pirates who chanced to be cruising about in
    their ships round the coast of Ireland. Then he went to Gruffydd,
    King of North Wales, who was his friend and neighbour, and asked
    him if he would help him also. Gruffydd agreed readily, for he
    hated the English, and soon a fleet of Danish ships came sailing
    up the Severn, full of fierce pirates and wild Welshmen, all of
    whom were sworn to obey Elfgar and Gruffydd.</p>
  <p>
    They came to the West Country because they knew there were a great
    many rich churches there that they could plunder, and as soon as
    the river became too shallow for their ships, they disembarked,
    and marched in the direction of Hereford.</p>
  <p>
    Now, as perhaps you know, Edward the Confessor was very fond of
    the Normans, and he had made one of his favourites, a Norman noble
    named Ralph, Earl of Hereford. This Ralph was a brave man, and
    quite ready to lead the citizens and the people of the
    neighbourhood out against the lawless invaders, but he made one
    great mistake.</p>
  <p>
    It was the custom, in his own land, for all the gentlemen to fight
    on horseback, instead of on foot, as was the way of the
    Anglo-Saxons, and he insisted on his followers following the
    foreign fashion, setting the example himself, with the result that
    everyone felt awkward and embarrassed, and very soon it became
    evident that Elfgar and his friends were going to have the best of
    it.</p>
  <p>
    Seeing this, Earl Ralph lost his head, and ran away, and perhaps
    we cannot wonder that the simple country folk followed his
    example, although, alas! one or two hundred of them were overtaken
    and killed before they had gone very far.</p>
  <p>
    Then the victorious hoard of savages, for they were little else,
    swept on, straight to the Cathedral, where they knew that the holy
    vessels, at least, and the ornaments on the altar, would be of
    gold or silver.</p>
  <p>
    But if they thought that they could obtain these easily they were
    mistaken, for they had not reckoned on the kind of men with whom
    they had to deal. For the brave priests determined to defend their
    church to the last, and shut and barricaded the doors in their
    faces; and, although at last they were overcome and the church
    looted, it was not until seven of their number lay dead in the
    great Western doorway.</p>
  <p>
    A scene of wild confusion followed, and when the wild invaders
    marched away again there was nothing left of the little city or of
    the great church which Æthelstan had restored with so much labour
    and pride but a few smouldering ruins.</p>
  <p>
    Among other things, King Ethelbert’s shrine was destroyed, and,
    although we hope that his bones were taken care of, and buried
    somewhere in the church, or else burned up altogether, we cannot
    tell for certain what became of them.</p>
  <p>
    Now, if there is one thing which we admire more than another about
    the grand old builders of the Middle Ages, it is their
    perseverance.</p>
  <p>
    They would spend a hundred years over the planning and building of
    a church, when one man died another taking his place; and when—as
    happened here, and many times elsewhere—the church was destroyed,
    either by accident or design, they lost no time in useless
    lamentations, but just patiently began to build it up again,
    trusting that in the future a time would come when their work
    would be prized and taken care of, as it deserved to be.</p>
  <p>
    So we find that in a very few years the work was begun once more
    from the beginning, this time by a Norman Bishop, named Robert de
    Losinga; and we are glad to know that his work remains, for if we
    go into the Cathedral we can see part of it still standing, for it
    was under his directions that parts of the choir and of the south
    transept were built.</p>

      HEREFORD CATHEDRAL: SCREEN.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="v6">
    That was more than eight hundred years ago.</p>
  <p>
    Then followed the building of the nave, the Lady-chapel, the north
    transept, and the tower, until, some four hundred years after
    Bishop Losinga had begun it, the great church was completed, and
    stood much as it stands to-day, except that a wooden spire
    surmounted the square tower of stone.</p>
  <p>
    This spire was taken down in 1790.</p>
  <p>
    Now that we have learned all about its history, let us enter the
    Cathedral and look what it is like inside.</p>
  <p>
    As you see, it is built of red stone, in the form of a cross, the
    choir being separated from the nave by a curious screen, which is
    made of four metals—iron, copper, brass, and bronze.</p>
  <p>
    The nave is very grand and stately, with rows of massive Norman
    pillars and beautifully carved arches.</p>
  <p>
    Although St. Ethelbert’s shrine no longer exists, if we go into
    the choir we can see the place where it stood—here, in this arch,
    between the two pillars nearest the altar on our right-hand side
    as we face it. A statue of the murdered King has been placed, as
    you see, on a pedestal, close to one of the pillars, and here, on
    the floor, in front of the altar, is a circular slab of marble, on
    which is traced a representation of his murder.</p>
  <p>
    But if we cannot visit St. Ethelbert’s shrine, we can visit
    another, which is six hundred years old, and which was erected to
    hold the bones of a very celebrated Bishop of Hereford, who was
    such a good man, that, after his death, people thought he deserved
    the name of Saint;—Thomas de Cantilupe.</p>
  <p>
    It stands in the north transept, and is just a great marble chest,
    with what looks like another ‘openwork’ chest, also of marble,
    above it.</p>
  <p>
    Round the sides of the lower chest a great many figures are
    carved, and if we look at them closely we shall see that they are
    figures of Knights Templars, with their cloaks and crosses, for
    Bishop de Cantilupe was Grand Master of that Order.</p>
  <p>
    Perhaps he obtained this office because he was very fond of
    soldiers, and when he was a little boy he wanted to become one.</p>
  <p>
    This was a very natural wish, for he was the son of a powerful
    Baron, who had an estate and ‘manor’ in Buckinghamshire, and to
    become a soldier was the common lot of most boys in his
    position.</p>
  <p>
    He had an uncle, or great-uncle, however, who was Bishop of
    Worcester, and this Prelate had other hopes for his nephew’s
    career.</p>
  <p>
    One day, when little Thomas was staying with him, he asked the
    child what he would like to be.</p>
  <p>
    ‘A soldier,’ said the boy promptly, looking up in the Bishop’s
    face.</p>
  <p>
    The old man patted him gently on the head.</p>
  <p>
    ‘Then, sweetheart, thou <i>shalt</i> be a soldier, but a soldier
    of the King of kings,’ he replied, ‘and thou shalt fight under the
    banner of thy namesake, St. Thomas of Canterbury, and thy harness
    shall be the cassock of a priest.’</p>
  <p>
    So the little fellow put the idea of earthly warfare out of his
    head, and set himself to study Greek and Latin instead, and when
    he was older he went to Oxford, and then to Paris with his brother
    Hugh, and soon became a very distinguished student.</p>
  <p>
    When he returned to England he became Chancellor of the University
    of Oxford, and a very good Chancellor he was, for he knew how to
    rule the students who were often very high-spirited and turbulent,
    just as students are nowadays.</p>
  <p>
    But their high spirits took rougher and more dangerous forms, just
    as the times were rougher and more dangerous, for they used to
    fight with one another with swords, and bows and arrows, and the
    Chancellor used to get hold of these weapons and confiscate them,
    until such time as their owners came to beg them back on condition
    that they kept the peace.</p>
  <p>
    Afterwards King Henry III. gave him a more important position,
    that of Chancellor of England, for you must remember that in those
    days the clergy were politicans as well as priests, and often held
    the highest offices of State. Then, in 1275, when he was quite an
    elderly man, he became Bishop of Hereford.</p>
  <p>
    And a true ‘Father in God’ he proved himself to be, to the poor
    people, at least, for he had one or two very serious and rather
    funny quarrels with the rich and powerful nobles who lived in his
    Diocese. These quarrels arose not because he was jealous of his
    own dignity, but because he was jealous of the dignity of the
    Church, and he imagined that any slight or insult paid to him as
    Bishop, was really a slight and insult paid to the Church of
    God.</p>
  <p>
    In fact, he must have been rather a puzzle to the rich people over
    whom he was set to rule in spiritual matters, for some of his
    views were so different from theirs.</p>
  <p>
    They saw that he was haughty and imperious to anyone, no matter
    how great he might be, who disobeyed him, or encroached on his
    dignity, and they saw also that he was always splendidly dressed,
    like a King indeed, for he wore a tunic trimmed with Royal
    miniver, and had a miniver covering to his bed.</p>
  <p>
    But they did not understand that under his haughtiness and
    imperiousness, which certainly were faults, and under the apparent
    luxuriousness of his dress, lay a very real desire, not for his
    own honour and glory, but for the honour and glory of the King of
    kings, whose ambassador he felt himself to be.</p>
  <p>
    Sometimes they caught a glimpse of his real self and were more
    puzzled still, for when they were dining with him they would see
    him deliberately pass dish after dish which they knew he was very
    fond of, and content himself with the plainest and poorest fare,
    in order that he might learn to say ‘No’ to his own wishes.</p>
  <p>
    Then, when the meal was ended he would rise, and select some
    dainty from the table, and carry it out of the hall with his own
    hands; and if he had been followed, he would have been found
    beside the bed of some poor sick servant, coaxing him to eat what
    he had brought to him.</p>
  <p>
    They knew also that he ordered bales and bales of woollen stuff to
    give to the poor in winter, with which to make stout cloaks and
    petticoats, and that he examined the goods most carefully when
    they arrived, to see that the colours were nice and bright, and
    just what he wanted them to be.</p>
  <p>
    Once, as was his wont, he was going to visit a poor sick person in
    a miserable hovel in the town, when a high-born Baron met him, and
    remonstrated with him, telling him that such work was beneath his
    dignity, and that he should leave it to the common clergy.</p>
  <p>
    ‘Sire,’ replied Bishop Thomas gravely, ‘I have to give an account
    to God for the souls of the poor as well as of the rich;’ and the
    Baron had no answer to make.</p>
  <p>
    There is just one other story which I will tell you about him, and
    this shows his haughty and imperious side.</p>
  <p>
    The Castle at Ledbury belonged to him as Bishop, so did the right
    of hunting over the Malvern Hills, which were Church lands.</p>
  <p>
    It is quite possible that he did not care in the least for hunting
    himself, and that he would have granted the privilege to anyone
    who had come and asked him for it. But when, one day, he was
    riding with his attendants on these same Malvern Hills, and heard
    the sound of a hunting-horn, and, on asking what it meant, was
    told that Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who was at that
    time the most powerful noble in England, also claimed the right of
    hunting there, and was out that day with his hounds, his anger
    rose, and he rode forward alone to meet the Earl and order him off
    the ground.</p>
  <p>
    The Earl looked at him contemptuously, and, answering with a sneer
    that ‘he was not going to be driven off his ancestral land by a
    “clergiaster,”’ and that ‘he had a good mind to chastise him for
    his impertinence,’ rode on.</p>
  <p>
    Not a word spoke the Bishop; he simply turned his horse’s head and
    galloped back to his attendants.</p>
  <p>
    A few hours later the Earl and his followers, tired out with the
    chase, had dismounted, and were resting under the shade of a
    wide-spreading oak, when the trampling of hoofs was heard.</p>
  <p>
    Looking up, they saw an extraordinary procession, a procession
    which was generally only to be seen in a church.</p>
  <p>
    There was the Bishop in the foreground, vested in mitre, cope, and
    stole, and there, behind him, rode his attendant priests and
    acolytes, carrying lighted candles, and a great bell, and a
    book!</p>
  <p>
    And while the Earl stared at them, half in anger, half in fear,
    the book was opened, the candles extinguished, the bell tolled,
    the most solemn curses of the Church levelled at his head, and a
    form of excommunication read, whereby he was denied all the rites
    of his religion, even Christian burial itself.</p>
  <p>
    And all this because he had hunted the wild deer on the Malvern
    Hills in defiance of Bishop de Cantilupe, which in Bishop de
    Cantilupe’s eyes meant in defiance of Almighty God.</p>
  <p>
    It was not only with the English Barons that the Bishop had
    differences, he had them with the Pope himself, when he thought
    that the rights of the Church of England were being tampered with;
    and it was when he was returning from Rome after having been to
    the Pope about one of those differences, that he died in Italy,
    on August&nbsp;25,&nbsp;1282.</p>

      HEREFORD CATHEDRAL: TOMB OF BISHOP CANTILUPE.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="v6">
    His desire was that his bones should be laid to rest in his own
    Cathedral Church in far-away England, so, as it was an almost
    impossible task to convey a dead body across Europe in those days,
    do you know what his followers did? They <i>boiled</i> his body,
    until the flesh separated from the bones; then they buried the
    flesh in the Church of St. Severus near Florence, and the bones,
    which were now quite easy to carry, they brought to Hereford, and
    buried them in the Lady-chapel. They were afterwards removed to a
    little chapel known as the Chapel of St. Catherine, and at last
    this beautiful shrine was prepared for them, and they were placed
    inside.</p>
  <p>
    Not very far from the shrine of Thomas de Cantilupe, on the east
    wall of the transept, there are two tablets, one above the other,
    which I think you would like to look at, for they tell a very
    curious and pathetic story.</p>
  <p>
    As you see, they have both been placed there in memory of the same
    man, Captain Arkwright, but not at the same time. For if you read
    the inscriptions you will see that one of them is thirty-one years
    older than the other.</p>
  <p>
    Captain Arkwright was a young soldier who was very fond of
    Alpine-climbing; and on October&nbsp;13,&nbsp;1866, he set out to
    try to ascend Mont Blanc. He never returned, for he was caught in
    an avalanche, and swept away out of sight. Although careful search
    was made, his body could not be found, and after a time all hope
    of ever finding it was given up, and this topmost tablet was
    erected to his memory.</p>
  <p>
    Thirty-one years passed by, and those of his friends who were
    alive had become elderly men and women, and I suppose his memory
    had grown a little dim to them, when strange news came from the
    little village of Chamonix, which lies at the foot of the great
    White Mountain.</p>
  <p>
    You all know what a glacier is? A river of ice which moves very
    very slowly down the side of a snow mountain, but which comes at
    last to the region where the air is so warm that it melts, and
    runs away down into the valley in a torrent of muddy water.</p>
  <p>
    Well, Captain Arkwright’s body had been swept by the avalanche
    into a deep crevasse, or ‘crack’ in one of these glaciers, and all
    these years it had been moving, encased in ice, slowly down the
    mountain, until, on August&nbsp;23,&nbsp;1897, it appeared at the
    foot of the glacier near Chamonix, in a perfect state of
    preservation, just as it was on the day when he was killed.</p>
  <p>
    It was taken from the ice which had held it so long and so
    mysteriously, and laid in Chamonix churchyard, and one of
    Arkwright’s old schoolfellows, who by this time had become Dean of
    this Cathedral, had the second, or lower, tablet erected as a
    memorial of the strange event.</p>
  <p>
    Now let us cross the church, and go into the south transept to
    look at a curious raised tomb which stands there, which I am sure
    all the little boys and girls, at least, would like to look at.</p>
  <p>
    As you see, three figures rest upon it. A father, a mother, and a
    tiny little baby, who lies half-hidden among the draperies of her
    mother’s gown.</p>
  <p>
    If you look at the baby’s forehead you can trace the letters of
    her name, ‘Anne’; and this tells you that the tomb is what is
    known as a ‘chrysome’—that is, it is the burial-place of a little
    child who died within a month of its baptism, and who was buried
    in its baptismal robe. As a rule in such a case, a cross is marked
    on the baby’s brow, but this child is marked with its name
    instead.</p>
  <p>
    The girl-mother, for she was only eighteen, who died when her baby
    was born, and was buried along with her, was the wife of a knight
    named Sir Alexander Denton, who was so broken-hearted at his loss
    that he made up his mind that he would never marry again, and that
    when he died he also would be buried here.</p>
  <p>
    But in later years he married another lady, and, after all, was
    buried in a church in Buckinghamshire, though, as you see, his
    effigy has been placed here to make the family group complete.</p>
  <p>
    There are three very ancient things belonging to this Cathedral at
    which we must look before we leave it—a very old map, which hangs
    in that wooden case on the wall, quite close to the ‘chrysome’
    tomb; a very old chair which stands on the north side of the
    altar; and a very old manuscript, which we can see in the
    library.</p>
  <p>
    Let us look at the map first. At one time it was believed to be
    the oldest map in the world, and although an older one has been
    discovered in Germany, the two must have been made about the same
    time, for they closely resemble each other.</p>
  <p>
    As you may think, it is very precious, so precious that during the
    time of the Civil War it was hidden under the floor of a little
    chantry on the other side of the church, and was only discovered
    some hundred and fifty years ago.</p>
  <p>
    If we examine it we shall see what the people who lived in the
    year 1300 or thereabouts imagined the world to be like. To begin
    with, they made the top of the map east, and the bottom west, so
    their ideas of direction were different from ours.</p>
  <p>
    The world is round, surrounded by the sea, and at the top of it
    lies the garden of Eden, with rivers running out of it. In the
    centre is Jerusalem, and all round that city are representations
    of Old Testament events: the Flood, and the Ark; the Red Sea, and
    the journey of the Children of Israel; Lot’s wife, etc.</p>
  <p>
    Great Britain is marked on the map, with the names of very few
    towns, but most of the Cathedrals are noted; while the other
    countries of Europe are also shown, with the animals which were
    supposed to live there, and it is very curious to notice how
    monkeys were believed to live in Norway, and serpents in
    Germany.</p>
  <p>
    We must not spend too much time here, however, for we have still
    to see the old chair and the old book.</p>
  <p>
    The chair is in the sanctuary, on the north side of the altar. It
    stands here because it was used as the Bishop’s chair (for it is
    so plain we can hardly call it a throne) until the present throne,
    which stands near the choir-stalls, was erected.</p>
  <p>
    We do not know when it was made, or how many Bishops have sat in
    it, but it must be at least nearly eight hundred years old, for we
    know that the wicked King Stephen visited Hereford, after its
    Bishop had been forced to fly, and in his pride and arrogance
    dared to sit in his place during Service, wearing his Royal
    crown.</p>
  <p>
    Now let us go out by this door in the south wall of the nave, and
    pass along what is known as the ‘Bishop’s Cloister,’ until we come
    to the library which is built on the site of the ‘Old West
    Cloister.’ The building is new, but the books it contains are very
    ancient and valuable.</p>
  <p>
    For this is a chained library—that is, most of the books are
    fastened by chains to a rod which is placed above the shelf on
    which they stand, so that anyone can take them down, and lay them
    on the broad desk-like shelf which finds a place below the
    bookshelves, and read them there, but they cannot be taken
    away.</p>
  <p>
    Here is the very ancient book which I have mentioned. It is a copy
    of the Gospels, written in Anglo-Saxon characters, and it must be
    at least a thousand years old.</p>
  <p>
    But old as it is, there are many other books, bound in boards of
    thin oak covered with sheepskin, which are quite as
    interesting.</p>
  <p>
    Here are two Prayer-Books, for example, one of which lets us see
    the Order of Service used at Hereford in 1265, the other that
    which was used at Bangor, in Wales, in 1400.</p>
  <p>
    They are quite different, and, as you look at them, the librarian
    will tell you that one is ‘Hereford Use,’ the other ‘Bangor
    Use.’</p>
  <p>
    For you must understand that long ago the Service in church was
    not the same all over England, as it is to-day. One form of
    Service was used in one Cathedral, and in all the surrounding
    district; another, a little different, was used in another, and so
    on.</p>
  <p>
    In this way there was a ‘Roman Use,’ which was the same as that
    used in Rome; a ‘Sarum Use,’ which was the most common, and was
    the same as that used at Salisbury; a ‘Hereford Use’; a ‘Lincoln
    Use’; a ‘York Use’; and a ‘Bangor Use.’</p>
  <p>
    Let us take down this enormous volume, and see what it contains.
    The whole of the Books of Genesis and Exodus, with beautifully
    printed notes, and spaces for other notes, which have never been
    put in. Look how straight and neat and symmetrical the columns of
    printing are, and the spaces between them. How did the monks
    manage this, do you think? See, these tiny punctures in the
    vellum, like tiny pin-pricks, tell us. They used a little wheel
    with tiny spikes in the rim, to space their columns.</p>
  <p>
    Here is an ancient book of devotion. To whom did it belong? Open
    it and you will find out, for ‘H. Latimer’ is written inside—he
    who died for his belief at Worcester.</p>
  <p>
    Here is the ‘Neuremberg Chronicle,’ a famous book in bygone days,
    for it was almost the only picture-book that children had, and it
    contains two thousand quaint woodcuts, showing the progress of the
    world from the Creation down to the time it was written.</p>
  <p>
    Here is a ‘Breeches’ Bible, which gets its name from the fact that
    the printer has printed that Adam and Eve made themselves
    ‘breeches’ instead of ‘aprons’; and near it is a ‘Cider’ Bible,
    which was printed by a man named Nicolas de Hereford, who was so
    accustomed to the beverage used in his native county that he
    translated the verse in Judges, which tells us that Sampson’s
    mother was to drink no strong drink, by ‘drink no cider.’</p>
  <p>
    Here we can see William the Conqueror’s seal, and here is that of
    Oliver Cromwell.</p>
  <p>
    Indeed, there are so many interesting and curious things to be
    seen in the chained library at Hereford that a book could be
    written about them alone.</p>
